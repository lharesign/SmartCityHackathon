        <p class="news-paragraph minimize">Singapore pupils aged over seven must use the city state's contact-tracing app or wearable device from December.

            Both use Bluetooth signals to log any contact with other users' devices.
            
            Pupils do not always have access to their phones but free tokens that can be worn on a lanyard or carried are being given away at community centres.
